Welcome!

This website is a mish mash of everything Brian Gray is into, exactly to the extent that those things make sense to put into a web site and I have the motivation to put them in. By day I'm a senior software engineering leader, and have been in the field in one way or another for over 3 decades. Nights and weekends? Well I get into plenty of trouble with:

- Songwriting, performance, recording, production
- Solving complex puzzles via software, often by reinventing the wheel, not because it is easy, but because it is fun
- Building things, fixing things, tinkering
- Talking and infodumping about all the things I'm into
- More and more lately, modding a Jeep and taking to the outdoors with my wife. Roadtripping, camping, etc.

If you found your way here, thank you! If you want to find all the other places I get to around the net, here's a list of them:
