I decided to document and link the ideas I have rolling around my head. I always thought ideas would be the hardest part of songwriting, but once I got my head in the right space, they’re just everywhere. In fact I had two new ones today (depending on when you read this, the preceding may be false). It feels uncomfortable sharing them before they’re written, but my music is all open, why not the development of the ideas for the music? If anyone beats me to implementation, I say go ahead. Maybe we can compare songs afterward and cross-promote. Just understand that the content below is just as covered by Creative Commons as is the final product. That is to say, any clearly copyrightable materials — for example sample lyrics posted — would need attribution if used for a derivative work, and cannot be used for commercial purposes without permission. Pure ideas though cannot be copyrighted, so no rules there.

Here are the ideas, in no particular order other than alphabetical by title:

“All Me”
: I’m at the Oscars accepting my award and giving my speech. I choose not to thank anyone, and instead praise myself for having done all the work to make this happen.

“Bubble Wrap Life”
: Living safely, not taking chances, protected by bubble wrap. Pop the bubbles one by one to start being more alive.

“I Blame the Zombies”
: Crooked pictures, late bills, not keeping up with the cleaning, etc. Chorus: I blame the zombies. We’re actually in a zombie apocalypse, and so it rationally wouldn’t be expected that I take care of all the mundane things. That’s the joke.

“Can’t Complain”
: Comment on how no one really wants to hear your problems. How’s it going? Can’t complain.

“Class Action”
: Lawsuit (possibly narrated as opening arguments) against Hogwarts for criminal neglect and child endangerment.

“Could Be Worse”
: You’ve been dumped, and you came to me for consolation. I’m really bad at it and say all kinds of stuff that would make it worse.

Donglerama
: Apple products needing dongles to connect to anything; the iron may be cold on this one now

“Financial Planning”
: My retirement plan is to win the lottery, live large, and leave all my friends behind.

“Fuck You Money”
: I’ve got “fuck you” money now, so I don’t have to care about my job so much. Dare them to fire me.

“Geek Girl”
: Pretty obvious. I’d ask what are the odds of us finding each other, but you already know.

“Guitar Guy”
: The guy with the guitar at the frat party. You know who I’m talking about.

“Henchman’s Lament”
: He’s the real brains behind the operation. Doesn’t get credit. Disgruntled. “Henchman, my ass.”

“My P-ness”
: Myers-Briggs-based discussion of a couple split along the P/J boundary, and their differences. Really just an excuse to make a very crass joke. Not sure if a whole song is warranted.

“No Place in the World”
: Caught between two world. Be vague at first, could be mixed-race, bisexuality, etc. Then it’s actually about I use vi and emacs, Windows and Mac, etc.

“OCD Love Song”
: I have OCD. I’m listing off why I love you from that perspective, counting things, checking things, etc. Maybe work certain types of repetition into the lyrics and music that reinforce the theme.

“Paprika”
: Kind of random, may not make sense. List a lot of spices and reasons I don’t want to be them. I want to be your paprika. Maybe never explain why.

“Perfect Match”
: We’re perfect for each other because we hate all the same things & people.

✅ “Popular Table”
: “I’m sitting at the popular table today”, used both in future and present tense as the song progresses. Starts hopeful and excited, remains upbeat while revealing that the plan does not really work. I’m oblivious though, and when I’m the only one at the table, I conclude that I am now the only popular person at school/work.

"Postcard from Paradise"
: wish you were here (sad song)

“Self-Aware”
: Narrator is an android. Wants to be self-aware. Obviously ironic as he’s being existentially introspective, but maybe also could be an actual human who wants to know more about his own mind. Can I write it so it works both ways?

“Shuffle”
: Some kind of metaphor involving the shuffling of zombies and shuffling paperwork for a living.

“To Reach You”
: I’m a robot arm toiling in a factory. You are a female robot arm on the other side of the factory. I long to be with you but I’m bolted in place and cannot reach.

“When Jews Go Camping”
: We’re in the woods. Stars, trees, romantic. But the mosquitos, pine needles, and spiders. Oh dear god the spiders.

“Zombie Pacman”
: The zombie pacman is a metaphor for brain cancer. The hook is “Where’s a ghost when you fucking need one?!”. Geeky but serious, thematically redundant now that I’ve written “One More Cloud”. Also, the profanity was part of getting out some feelings when I conceived it, but may not fit on my album. [UPDATE] If I write “Fuck You Money”, I’ll have burned the bridge of profanity pretty well into the river. No point not letting this song replace “One More Cloud” if it ends up album-worthy. [UPDATE 2] The profanity ship has sailed under the designation “USS Just You and Me”. As the chorus repeats, any show I sing that in gets bumped up past the PG-13 level.
