Amidst all the coding and testing and whatnot, it pays to remember what I'm actually making my website FOR, and that's music. So here's a new song I wrote over the weekend:

[Just You and Me](http://briangraymusic.com/?toptab=1&song=justyouandme)

I'd tell you about it, but the whole point of this web site thing is to stop having all my information replicated in all the different places. So follow the link and read the "Notes" tab if you're interested in what I may have previously said in a blog (or Facebook) entry. Enjoy this. The next time you hear from me, it will probably be about some more boring web development stuff.
