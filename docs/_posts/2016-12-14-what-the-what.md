Sup?

It’s been quite a while since I published a new song, so what’s going on? Well, I’ve been spending quite a bit of my time and energy working on the recording/production studio in my basement. There is now quite literally light at the end of a figurative tunnel. What I’ve completed, in broad strokes:

1. Design
2. Demolition of a room that was already there
3. Walls framed
4. Ceiling framed
5. Ventilation completed
6. Electrical completed and inspected
7. Lighting installed (5-zone 24V LED strips)
8. Insulation

What’s left to have a usable room (my “Minimum Viable Product”)?

1. Sheath ceiling (1/2 done)
2. Build and hang doors
3. Sheath walls

At that point Zoe and I will be able to move in and start using the room to record. Of course at this point there’s no floor, so we’re standing on concrete. No primer/paint on the walls & ceiling. No trim, guitar hangers, whiteboards, other accoutrements. And we won’t be using the microphone snake cable I have running through the ceiling to a patch bay connected to a mixer. Also no acoustic treatment, sound absorbers, diffuser in the back of the room, bass traps in the corners, etc. But it should still be way better than recording in a bedroom, and the entire room was designed to sound good enough without treatment (no parallel walls; weird angles in both walls and ceiling).

Oh yeah, you may not know what it’s going to look like! Here’s the high-level floorplan with the rest of my basement for context:

For finer resolution on the progress details, check out the [Trello Board](http://briangraymusic.com/?toptab=3) on my website.

As for right now, I’m in training. I’ve committed to doing at least 30-60 min of work every evening until 12/20, to get my muscles in the right shape for intensive building. Then, starting 12/21, I have 13 consecutive days off work, during which I’ll be hitting it hard and trying to finish my MVP by the end of the year. We’ll see what happens I guess. Mounting the larger panels on the ceiling really is a bitch.

Watch for photo updates on my [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/bgraymusic), when I get around to making the album there. I am trying to snap progress photos whenever I remember to.
