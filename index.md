I really don’t update my blog much, so I’m pinning this all-purpose, introductory post to the top. Where to begin?

I make music, so that’s something. I also decided to code up my own web site, and more recently my own blog to embed (you're reading it right now) in it, so that tells you a bit more. Oh yeah, here’s me:

What about that music? That sounds interesting! Well it is to me, which kind of sums it up. I write whatever’s on my mind, whatever amuses me at the moment, and often that intersects with what someone else (like a songwriting competition) challenges me to do. In the end, it turns out I’m a nerd at heart, always have been, always will be. So me writing stuff from my own head ends up being nerdy music, and an internet search informs me there’s a term for that!

I mean, really all I’m trying to say is I have a web site, and I do stuff, but mostly music. So click the Music tab and give it a listen. If you like it, become a Patron, follow me on social media. If you want to follow the progress on my studio buildout or the code for this site, there are tabs for those too! And I'll probably be writing in here about my coding adventures, because that's where my brain is at lately. Stay tuned for how that changes…
