By popular demand, I have made it easier to share a link that leads someone to a specific song on my web site. Essentially, whenever you navigate through the site by clicking tabs or accordion headers, I push a new URL to the address bar. So at any point if you like the song you're looking at, you can copy the link at the top. That link will return others to the same main tab (News, Music, etc.), song, and tab within the song (Lyrics, Notes, etc.). It will also scroll the viewport so the song title is as close to the top as possible (stuff near the bottom cannot always be scrolled all the way up because I don't want to leave empty space at the bottom).

Now people won't always hear the same song you're hearing, because the sound playing is orthogonal to the item you're reading. I might add a button that causes the display to open the playing song as it starts, but that must remain an optional feature as I can see people wanting to read the notes for the previous song even after the next one has begun playing. Automatically closing the notes and opening the next one might be a bad user experience. What do you think the default should be? Have the display follow the playing song if not told otherwise? Or stay put by default and only start following when told to?
